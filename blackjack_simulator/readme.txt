#Notes
########################
- Depending on your Jupyter notebook setup, you'll likely need to upload the 4 .txt files into a top level directory accessible to the Jupyter notebook.
- From there, the Jupyter notebook is well annotated and should run without errors (dependent on a few python libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, random, and pprint). 
- The Jupyter notebook has the outputs from the most recent "run" by the Blackjack simulator.
- The Notebook took about an hour to run from start to finish
